# my-bullet-journal
"My Bullet Journal" is an electronic representation of the pen-and-paper bullet journaling system. It has two main components: the Daily Log, which allows users to create to-do lists for each day, and Plan My Day!, which generates an optimized schedule that plans out when each task should be completed.

This project requires the user to have Python v3.5 installed. The user can then run the program using a program like Sublime or Pyzo or through their system's command prompt.

No third-party installation is required to run the program.
